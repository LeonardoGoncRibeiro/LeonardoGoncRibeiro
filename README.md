### ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I am a graduate and have a master's degree in engineering from the Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡. My research was focused on the use of Bayesian models to assist in the optimization of structures.
- ðŸ‘€ Today, i am interested in entering in field of data science. I intend to apply for a doctorate in the area soon, studying Machine Learning models.
- I am currently looking for jobs as a data analyst or as a data scientist jr. As so, i am looking for opportunities and collaboration in projects related to data science and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL. I am putting wome of my classnotes on Github, as well as some personal projects. 

#### Programming languages I have already worked on: C++, MATLAB, Octave, Julia, Python, FORTRAN, R, SQL, and others.

### Personal projects:

In my projects, I try to be very informative on my thought process, so that anyone can understand and learn from what I am doing. Feel free to make any suggestion or to give me a feedback.
