### ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I am a graduate and have a master's degree in engineering from the Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡. My research was focused on the use of Bayesian models to assist in the optimization of structures.
- ðŸ‘€ Today, i am interested in entering in field of Data Science. I intend to apply for a doctorate in the area soon, and currently I am studying Machine Learning models and making some personal projects for my portfolio.
- I am currently looking for jobs as a Data Analyst or as a Data Scientist Jr. As so, i am looking for opportunities and collaboration in projects related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning modeling techniques and Deep Learning, especially applied to the financial market. I am putting wome of my classnotes on my repositories, and I am currently working on some bigger personal projects. 

#### Programming languages I have already worked on: C++, MATLAB, Octave, Julia, Python, FORTRAN, R, SQL, and others.

### Personal projects:

In my projects, I try to be very informative on my thought process, so that anyone can understand and learn from what I am doing. Feel free to make any suggestion or to give me a feedback.
